# Custom Colors Modifier

## Overview
This module implements a Modifier which allows you to use arbitrary colors. It
is possible to set background, text and link color accompanied by :hover
variants.

Optionally you can set media queries and transition duration.

If you need to use controlled vocabulary for color selection you can use the
Colors Modifier (modifiers_colors) module.
